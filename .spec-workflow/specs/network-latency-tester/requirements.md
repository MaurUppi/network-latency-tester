# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for migrating the existing `check_ctok-v2.sh` bash script to a modern Rust implementation. The network latency tester is a comprehensive tool designed to measure network performance and connectivity to configurable target URLs using various DNS configurations. The Rust implementation will provide better performance, cross-platform compatibility, and maintainable code while preserving all existing functionality and adding environment-based configuration.

The tool performs systematic network latency measurements across multiple DNS providers (system default, custom DNS servers, and DNS-over-HTTPS), calculates detailed statistics, and provides color-coded performance feedback to help users identify optimal network configurations.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This migration supports modernization goals by:
- Replacing shell dependencies with a self-contained executable
- Improving performance through compiled Rust code
- Enhancing maintainability with type-safe, structured code
- Providing better cross-platform support
- Adding configuration flexibility through .env file support

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Network Testing Functionality

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want to test network latency to configurable target URLs, so that I can measure connectivity performance and identify network issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool is executed THEN it SHALL perform HTTP/HTTPS requests to configured target URLs
2. WHEN testing a URL THEN the tool SHALL measure DNS resolution time, connection establishment time, first byte time, and total request time
3. WHEN a request completes THEN the tool SHALL record the HTTP status code and timing metrics
4. IF a request fails due to timeout or network error THEN the tool SHALL record the failure and continue with remaining tests
5. WHEN all tests complete THEN the tool SHALL display results in a formatted table

### Requirement 2: DNS Configuration Support

**User Story:** As a network engineer, I want to test different DNS configurations including custom DNS servers and DNS-over-HTTPS, so that I can optimize DNS performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing begins THEN the tool SHALL test using system default DNS configuration
2. WHEN custom DNS servers are configured THEN the tool SHALL test using each specified DNS server
3. WHEN DNS-over-HTTPS providers are configured THEN the tool SHALL test using each DoH endpoint
4. IF a DNS configuration is not supported by the HTTP client THEN the tool SHALL skip that configuration and display appropriate warning
5. WHEN DNS testing completes THEN the tool SHALL display results grouped by DNS configuration type

### Requirement 3: Statistical Analysis and Reporting

**User Story:** As a performance analyst, I want detailed statistical analysis of multiple test runs, so that I can understand network performance consistency and variability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing a configuration THEN the tool SHALL perform multiple iterations (configurable count)
2. WHEN all iterations complete THEN the tool SHALL calculate average, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation for each timing metric
3. WHEN calculating statistics THEN the tool SHALL exclude failed requests from calculations
4. WHEN displaying results THEN the tool SHALL show success rate as a percentage
5. IF no successful requests occur THEN the tool SHALL display "FAILED" for all statistical metrics

### Requirement 4: Environment-Based Configuration

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to configure DNS servers, DoH providers, and target URLs through environment variables, so that I can easily customize testing for different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool starts THEN it SHALL load configuration from a .env file if present
2. WHEN target URLs are specified in environment THEN the tool SHALL use those instead of defaults
3. WHEN DNS servers are specified in environment THEN the tool SHALL include them in testing
4. WHEN DoH providers are specified in environment THEN the tool SHALL include them in testing
5. IF environment configuration is invalid THEN the tool SHALL display clear error messages and use defaults

### Requirement 5: Command Line Interface

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive command-line options to control testing behavior, so that I can integrate the tool into scripts and customize execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN --count is specified THEN the tool SHALL perform that many iterations per configuration
2. WHEN --timeout is specified THEN the tool SHALL use that timeout for HTTP requests
3. WHEN --verbose is specified THEN the tool SHALL display detailed statistics for each configuration
4. WHEN --debug is specified THEN the tool SHALL output detailed debugging information
5. WHEN --no-color is specified THEN the tool SHALL disable colored output
6. WHEN --url is specified THEN the tool SHALL test only that specific URL
7. WHEN --help is specified THEN the tool SHALL display usage information and exit

### Requirement 6: Output Formatting and Color Coding

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear, color-coded output that highlights performance issues, so that I can quickly identify optimal and problematic configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying results THEN the tool SHALL use green color for good performance (< 1 second total time)
2. WHEN displaying results THEN the tool SHALL use yellow color for moderate performance (1-3 seconds) or skipped configurations
3. WHEN displaying results THEN the tool SHALL use red color for poor performance (> 3 seconds) or failed configurations
4. WHEN success rate is below 80% THEN the tool SHALL display that configuration in red regardless of timing
5. WHEN color output is disabled THEN the tool SHALL display results in plain text format

### Requirement 7: Network Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a troubleshooter, I want basic network connectivity diagnostics before main testing, so that I can identify fundamental network issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing starts THEN the tool SHALL perform basic HTTP connectivity test
2. WHEN testing starts THEN the tool SHALL perform HTTPS connectivity test
3. WHEN testing starts THEN the tool SHALL test DNS resolution to common domains
4. IF basic connectivity fails THEN the tool SHALL display diagnostic information and continue
5. WHEN diagnostics complete THEN the tool SHALL test primary target connectivity before main testing

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As an operator, I want the tool to handle errors gracefully and continue testing, so that partial network issues don't prevent useful results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a single request fails THEN the tool SHALL continue with remaining iterations
2. WHEN a DNS configuration is unsupported THEN the tool SHALL skip it and continue
3. WHEN timeout occurs THEN the tool SHALL record failure and proceed to next test
4. WHEN invalid configuration is detected THEN the tool SHALL display clear error message
5. IF all requests for a configuration fail THEN the tool SHALL display failure status but continue with other configurations

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Separate modules for HTTP client, DNS configuration, statistics calculation, and output formatting
- **Modular Design**: Configuration parser, test executor, statistics engine, and reporter as independent modules
- **Dependency Management**: Minimal external dependencies, prefer standard library where possible
- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined traits for HTTP clients, DNS resolvers, and output formatters

### Performance
- Concurrent testing of different configurations when possible
- Efficient memory usage for large test iterations
- Fast startup time (< 100ms for typical usage)
- Minimal CPU overhead during network waiting

### Security
- Validate all user inputs including URLs and configuration values
- Secure handling of DNS-over-HTTPS connections with proper certificate validation
- No storage of sensitive information in configuration files
- Protection against malicious URLs or configuration injection

### Reliability
- Robust error handling for all network operations
- Graceful degradation when features are unavailable
- Deterministic behavior across different platforms
- Consistent results across multiple executions

### Usability
- Clear, self-explanatory output format
- Helpful error messages with suggested resolutions
- Comprehensive help documentation
- Intuitive command-line interface following Unix conventions
