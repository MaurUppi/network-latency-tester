## [0.1.9] - 2025-08-14

### Added
- **Multiple URL Support**: `--url` flag can now be used multiple times to test multiple targets simultaneously
- **Explicit Color Control**: Added `--color` flag to force colored output alongside existing `--no-color`
- **Enhanced Output**: Results now properly grouped by target URL with clear section headers and Unicode symbols

### Changed
- Updated CLI argument parsing with `ArgAction::Append` for multiple URLs
- Implemented composite result keys format: `"{url}::{dns_config_name}"`
- Enhanced output formatter with target-specific sections for better readability

### Fixed
- Compilation errors in error recovery system (added Clone trait to AppError)
- Async recursion issues in recovery strategy application
- CLI validation and error handling improvements

### Technical Improvements
- Added comprehensive CLI validation and error handling
- Updated configuration system to handle multiple targets
- Enhanced test execution engine for multiple URL support
- Improved result organization and display logic

### Testing
- All CLI unit tests passing (15/15)
- End-to-end testing with multiple URLs verified
- Color output control fully functional

### Compatibility
- **Backward Compatible**: All existing CLI functionality preserved
- Single URL usage works exactly as before
- `--test-original` behavior unchanged

This release resolves 2 critical bash parity test failures:
1. âœ… Multiple URL CLI error: `--url` can be used multiple times
2. âœ… Missing `--color` option: Explicit color control implemented

## [0.1.8] - 2025-08-14

### Fixed
- Fixed 'Use test_0 for optimal performance' recommendation issue
- Improved result key generation in executor

## [0.1.7] - 2025-08-14

### Fixed
- **Test Suite Reliability**: Resolved all 8 failing unit tests that were preventing successful development
  - Fixed CLI duration parsing to reject invalid formats (`+10`, `0x` prefixes)
  - Added comprehensive IPv6 DNS server support to validation system
  - Corrected help topic case-insensitive behavior expectations
  - Enhanced executor tuning with proper timing requirements for parameter scaling tests
  - Fixed correlation ID string handling in logging system for IDs shorter than 8 characters
  - Resolved console timing summary display to show actual configuration names instead of "Unknown"
  - Fixed `best_config()` method to return correct HashMap keys instead of internal config names

### Added
- **Strategic Planning**: Created comprehensive bash parity improvement plan
  - Added `.spec-workflow/specs/improvement/` directory structure
  - Documented strategic approach for handling 15 failing bash parity integration tests
  - Established framework for prioritizing CLI feature implementation based on user impact
