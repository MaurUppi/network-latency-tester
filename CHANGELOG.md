and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

## [0.1.6] - 2025-08-12

### Changed
- **DNS Result Ordering**: Results now grouped by DNS type (System DNS → Custom DNS → DoH) instead of pure performance sorting
- Within each DNS type group, configurations are still sorted by performance (best first)
- Improves result readability and provides logical grouping for better DNS comparison

### Technical Improvements
- Enhanced sorting algorithm to prioritize DNS type categorization while maintaining performance insights
- Updated sample outputs in documentation to reflect new ordering
- Removed tracked .env file from repository (keeping .env.example for reference)

## [0.1.5] - 2025-01-08

### Added
- Enhanced multi-URL performance reporting with target-specific grouping
- Always-visible target URL headers for improved clarity
- Realistic timing measurement estimates based on total request duration
- Improved performance analysis with accurate fast/slow classification

### Changed
- **Binary name changed from `network-latency-tester` to `nlt`** for easier command-line usage
- Performance recommendations now use actual DNS configuration names instead of confusing 'test_X' references
- Multi-URL scenarios now display results grouped by target with clear visual separation
- Single-URL scenarios now consistently show target headers for better visibility

### Fixed
- **Critical timing measurement bug**: Replaced hardcoded placeholder values with proportional estimates
- **Statistics calculation**: Added missing `calculate_statistics()` calls to populate test result metrics
- **Duration overflow protection**: Enhanced safe arithmetic to prevent runtime panics on macOS ARM64
- **Performance level display**: Fixed "Unknown" levels now showing proper "Good/Moderate/Poor" classifications
- **Recommendation accuracy**: Fixed misleading "All configurations slow" messages for excellent performance (37ms, 42ms)
- Repository URL correction in panic messages
- CI workflow compatibility issues with cross-compilation targets

### Technical Improvements
- Realistic timing breakdown: DNS (10%), TCP (20%), TLS (25% for HTTPS), First-byte (remainder)
- Enhanced duration safety with checked arithmetic operations
- Improved performance analysis based on actual test results instead of empty summaries
- Better error handling and user feedback for network issues

## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-08 (Initial Release)
